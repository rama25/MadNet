# Node.js Media Encryption

This Node.js script demonstrates a simple implementation for encrypting large media files using the AES-256-CBC cipher. The script breaks the input file into chunks, enhancing efficiency and making it suitable for scenarios where secure and swift encryption of large media files is required.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   
4. Run the script:
   node encrypt.js

5. Follow the prompts to enter the file name.

6. The encrypted file (enc_filename.mp4) will be generated.

##Usage##
This script is designed to provide a secure and efficient method for encrypting large media files.
